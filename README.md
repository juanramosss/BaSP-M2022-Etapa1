# Trackgenix 
This is the landing page for Trackgenix.
```
Download 'BaSP-M2022-Etapa1' folder and open 'index.html' file in your browser.
```

### Week 02
Learn HTML and try to emulate the landing page designed in figma in Week01.

### Week 03
Learn CSS and add styles to the previous work done on Week02 so that the product gets closer to the figma prototype.

### Week 04
Create a mobile-first landing page for Trackgenix using flex-box and media queries to create a responsive design.

I am not sure why when i run the inspector in the browser the mobile design does not work properly. To see mobile design, try without using the inspector, at least that worked for me :<>:

### Week 05

Learning JavaScript by doing several exercises, getting in touch with many JS functions and also creating new functions.
